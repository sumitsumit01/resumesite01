                <li>I graduated from my High School back in India with Non-Medical Science subjects in the year 2019
                    with
                    87% grades.
                    After that , I decided to study about Information Technology at Anand Institute of Management ,
                    Delhi .
                    Starting
                    from 2019 , I finished the course Diploma in IT in the year 2021 with 80% grades . After gaining all
                    that
                    information and experiencing the depth of technology I decided to learn more about it . Therefore ,
                    to
                    learn
                    more about the advance level of technology and programming languages , I chose Georgian as my study
                    destination
                    and came to
                    Canada. </li><br>
                <li>Learning - I love learning no matter from what source , therefore , I keep checking for Hackethons
                    like events on eventbrite or other similar sources and join them to learn about different and new
                    ideas of people. Also , there are several courses available for programmimg students to upskill
                    their level of knowledge . I keep participating in them no matter they provide certifications or
                    not.</li>
